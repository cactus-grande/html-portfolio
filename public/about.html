<p>Hi there, welcome to my first project page. My name is Tu, and I am a Vietnamese
  currently residing in the Netherlands.
  I am learning coding currently to upskill myself,
  hence this project was born to showcase my work.
  I hope to be able to not only improve on my technical skills,
  but to also utlise what I have learnt to my career in the future.</p>

<p>Some fun facts about me: I love Ghibli movies, especially Howl's Moving Castle and Castle in the Sky.
  In my free time, I tend to indulge myself with reading sci-fi or non-fiction books. I sometimes play ukulele
  when I come across I really enjoy listening to. Recently, I started learning coding when I have time as well. 
</p>

<p>As a Vietnamese by birth, I love cooking traditional Viet food and inviting others over to eat and chat 
  over different cuisines and hang out while playing board games. Do feel free to reach out to me if you are 
  up for it!
</p>
